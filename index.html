    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Jade Walker, currently completing a Level 3 Apprenticeship as an Infrastructure Technician. Over the last few years, I learned many new skills, including time keeping, responsibility and how to work as a team. I would like to be able to use these skills and improve them. I am a quick learner and am excited to gain new skills that will help me throughout my work, and in future roles. No matter what role I take up, I do it to the best of my ability. I hoping to find the right avenue towards my dream of working in cyber security in the next few years, and am considering Open University, to gain experience working while studying part-time. My first experience in the working world of IT was completing work experience in July 2018 with Roger Young Land Rover. This taught me a range of new skills such as time keeping, responsibility and how to work as a team. Ever since this experience, I have been motivated to enter the world of IT. Alongside my apprenticeship, I am working for a small IT company in Trowbridge, Wiltshire who specialise in Cloud Services such as websites, phone and broadband and dedicated servers. We assist many different companies and charities, from small establishments to large firms.

      This website is a centralised showcase for all work that I have completed, which can prove I can implement the skills I have learned throughout the years of study.
