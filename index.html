    <h2 >About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Jade Walker, currently completing a BSc in Cyber Security with Open University. I hoping to find the right avenue towards my dream of working in cyber security in the next few years, and am looking to complete OffSec PEN-200, CompTIA A+, Networking+ and Security+.
    <br>
    <br>
    Alongside completing my degree, I am working as a part-time IT Engineer for a large charity, who work in and around Somerset, UK. They are a charity that help people who are homeless, part of the GRBT community (gypsy, roma, boater and traveller), people who have experienced abuse in households and refugees, providing them links to key services and providing them with support. Over the last few years, I learned many new skills, including time keeping, responsibility and how to work as a team. I would like to be able to use these skills and improve them. I am a quick learner and am excited to gain new skills that will help me throughout my work, and in future roles. No matter what role I take up, I do it to the best of my ability.
    <br>
    <br>
    My first experience in the working world of IT was completing work experience in July 2018 with Roger Young Land Rover. Ever since this experience, I have been motivated to enter the world of IT, and I completed a Level 3 BTEC Extended Diploma in IT shortly afterwards, achieving a MMP status. It also spurred me on to complete a Level 3 Apprenticeship with City & Guilds, achieving a Distinction. My portfolio I submitted for this can be found below.<br>
    <br>

    This website is a centralised showcase for all work that I have completed, which can prove I can implement the skills I have learned throughout the years of study, both through traditional education and self-teaching.
