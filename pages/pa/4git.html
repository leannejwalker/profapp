	<p>
	I decided to use GitHub to track changes I made to the website. GitHub is a place where developers can use open-source code, making and tracking changes to both already created code or new code. GitHub will allow me back track at any time if changes I made were not correct. It will also help me understand other tools that I will need to use alongside GitHub. Plesk can integrate with GitHub so that any changes I make on the website will be shown on GitHub and the website. When coding, I use Visual Studios, which has GitHub built in. Once I have edited the code, I can commit changes, which means the changes have been logged. Once the changes have been logged, I can push any changes to Plesk, which then makes these changes live.
