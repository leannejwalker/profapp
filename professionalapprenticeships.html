<!--SETTING UP A HOSTING ACCOUNT (with case study)--> 

  <div class="black">
    <h3 class="h3" id=setup>Setting up a hosting account</h3>
	<p>To create a hosting account for the website, I used Plesk, which is a hosting control panel. I will need to create a customer account to set up my domain and create a platform for my website. It will also allow me to complete tasks such as setting up FTP access and applying SSLs. I created a new customer account by pressing “Add a customer”.
		<img src="img/pa/hosting/1.png" width="712" height="auto" alt="Add a Customer">
		<br>
	The first set of details are for accessing the customer account in Plesk. The second set of details are for the domain subscription. This sets up a set of properties for the website. 
		<img src="img/pa/hosting/2.png" alt="Customer details">
		<li>
	Domain name: - This is where I will input the domain name I will be using for the website: leannejade.co.uk. When loading a website, the users computer will access the server via the IP, not the domain name. As IPs can be difficult to remember, the DNS (Domain Name System) translates the IP into a domain name. An example of this is Google. To access google.com, you can type google.com in the address bar. Alternatively, you could type in 142.250.186.142 or 142.250.186.164.
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>
	IPv4/IPv6 address: - This is where I allocated an IP address to the domain. I have a choice between a shared or a dedicated IP. A shared IP is where multiple websites and domains are hosted on the same IP, whereas a dedicated IP is where one website, or a singular domain with multiple websites are hosted on an IP of their own.
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>
	The username and password are for the FTP access. FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is the protocol which deals with file transfer. This can be between two LANs (local area networks) such as computers on the same network, or between a LAN and a WAN (wide area network) such as a computer and a server. This will allow me to transfer the website files from my computer to the web server.
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>
	The service plan outlines what resources from the server that the website can use. This allows for a range resources including the amount of disk space the website can use the number of mailboxes that can be allocated to the domain and the number of domains, subdomains and aliases that can be allocated. Service plans ensure that each website gets sufficient resources that it requires. 
		</li>
		<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	I have now created my customer account.

	<div class="casestudy">
		<img src="img/pa/chlogo.png" alt="Cloud Heroes">
		<p>
			When I first started at Cloud Heroes, one of the first tasks I learned how to do was to create hosting accounts for customers. Hosting accounts consist of space for website hosting, DNS, and email storage. Setting up hosting accounts are very common when it comes to setting up new customers for one of our resellers, Expert Agent. They are a company that provide a platform for estate agents to run their business on.<br><br>
			When we first receive the request, we add it to our job system. We then go to the web interface of our web server and create a new hosting account. We first have to set up the user account, adding the details of the new customer Expert Agent has provided us with. We continue with adding the web hosting element to the user account by adding the domain to the hosting account, so that the web space is designated to the domain. Once we have added the domain, we can assign a subscription to it. A subscription tells the server how much space a domain can use on the server and can automatically block usage if over the limit or is taking advantage of the Fair Use Policy.<br><br>
			No DNS or email set up is required on these, as Expert Agent complete these themselves. We do have to provide log in details and FTP details so that Expert Agent can transfer websites to the new hosting account. Passwords are added securely to our customer portal, where they are viewable for 30 days before they are erased from the server. Once Expert Agent have completed this, we install an SSL to ensure the site stays secure.<br><br><br><br>In the Occupational Brief, this covers:<br><br>

			Communication: On a regular basis, I remotely contact Expert Agent, an external company, over e-mail.<br><br>
			Security: Cloud Heroes have a secure process of sending passwords, which erase them after 30 days. This process meets ISO standards. This is to protect Expert Agent and their end users. We also install an SSL, which adds a layer of security onto their websites. This is part of the hosting account set up process, shown above.<br><br>
			Problem solving: We must be compliant with Cloud Heroes guidelines to complete tasks, as the Cloud Heroes guidelines are in accordance with ISO standards.<br><br>
			Workflow Management: We receive these requests daily, so they are allocated to either myself or my colleagues, dependant on the work each of us are working on.  Setting up a hosting account only requires one person.<br><br>
			Performance: In this situation, we are setting up a hosting account, which will be held on a shared system. This will be using a GUI, or a piece of software installed onto a server to make it easier for the user to navigate around.<br><br>

<!--DNS PROPAGATION (with case study)-->

  <div class="grey">
   <h3 class="h3" id=dns>DNS Propagation</h3>
    <p>My next task is to make sure the domain is on the correct name server. Doing this ensures that I will be able to load the website files, hosted on Plesk, from the domain. This will then allow me to load the website files with the domain. At this moment in time, my domain leannejade.co.uk is currently pointing at my domain registrar, Namecheap’s name servers.
	<br><br>
	To change this, I will need to open both the DNS settings on Plesk, and the DNS settings on Namecheap. 
	<br>
    <br>
	<img src="img/pa/dns/1.png" alt="DNS settings">
	The name server is listed as an NS record in the DNS settings. This is the only record I need to copy onto the DNS settings on the domain registrar. 
	<br>
    <br>
	<img src="img/pa/dns/2.png" alt="NS Records">
	<li>
	The name server is listed as an NS record in the DNS settings. The host will be an @ as the @ symbol represents the current domain name. Alternatively, I could add the domain name as the host (leannejade.co.uk).
	</li>
	<li>
	The value is set to the name of the name server. The name server will also have a full stop at the end. If a full stop is not added to the end of the value, the record will automatically add the domain name afterwards (for example pl-ns2.jpcinet.co.uk.leannejade.co.uk). As it would no longer be pointing to the correct name servers, there would be an error when trying to load the website.
	</li>
	<li>
	TTL (Time To Live) is how much time a data packet will “live” within the network before it is made redundant. This can be between 600 seconds (10 minutes) and 86400 seconds (24 hours). Automatic TTL will set the data packet lifespan to the default set by the domain registrar. Namecheap’s default is 1800 seconds (30 minutes).
	</li>
	</p>
	<p>
	Now that I have set up the account and changed the name servers, I will need to wait for the DNS to propagate. In the meantime, I will start designing and building the website. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<div class="casestudy">
		<img src="img/pa/chlogo.png" alt="Cloud Heroes">
		<p>
			We received an email recently from Wiltshire Police for a DNS change. Once we entered the email contents into our ticketing system, we need to make sure that the request is coming from the account holder, or another person that the account holder has authorised. If the request did not come either of the above, we need confirmation from them to make the changes for security purposes. The request came from the account holder, so we can complete the changes.
			<br>
			<br>
			Wiltshire Police have a different system than outlined above, which is more secure compared to Plesk. Access is only allowed for Cloud Heroes, so we are required to make the changes on their behalf. The change is very similar to Plesk, however this system has 3 name servers whereas Plesk has 2. This can make it longer for all 3 to sync the changes. We can check if the changes have been completed via a tool called <a href="https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx" style="color:#3466AA;">MXToolbox</a>. This website allows you to check if certain records have synced correctly, and is used constantly here at Cloud Heroes. Once we are happy that the records can be seen and are synced, we can go back to the customer and confirm the changes have been completed. 
			<br>
			<br>
			When contacting customers outside of the ticketing system, we need to update the ticket manually. We reply to the email and copy the contents into the ticket we opened earlier. We also copy the ticket number, and add this to the end of the subject. This will allow us to have good record keeping, in case we need to retrieve the ticket in the future.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			In the Occupational Brief, this covers:
			<br>
			<br>
			Communication: Although we do not hear from them often, they usually send important details via e-mail, so that we don’t make incorrect changes. We usually receive a phone call to check for updates, or if there are any issues with the changes. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Security: Their DNS is held on a more secure server, as they are a .gov.uk domain holder. This process is different, as it requires access to a different DNS server compared to other customers. Because they’re on a secure server, access is limited to Cloud Heroes, so they are unable to self-serve. We require a main contact for the organisation, so changes can be requested by them for security. This protects the organisation from any DNS changes made by a person that they have not approved.
			<br>
			<br>
			Problem solving: We must be compliant with Cloud Heroes guidelines to complete tasks, as the Cloud Heroes guidelines are in accordance with ISO standards. We use a 3rd party tool to check, test and diagnose issues with DNS propagation. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Workflow Management: Although we do not receive these requests frequently, all DNS requests require tickets and need allocating. DNS changes only require one person but may require another for a second opinion if there are any issues. This would mean working with a colleague to find a solution to an issue.
			<br>
			<br>
			Performance: In this situation, we are making DNS changes, which will be held on a shared system. This will be using a GUI, or a piece of software installed onto a server to make it easier for the user to navigate around.			<br>

<!--WEBSITE DESIGN AND LAYOUT-->

  <div class="black">
   <h3 class="h3" id=webdes>Website design and layout</h3>
	<p>
	As the website will be a portfolio, I will be creating a site that is simple and easy to navigate. I will be using HTML, PHP and CSS. It will include a basic colour palette, so that the website looks professional and slick. The colours on the website will be in hex so that it can work with HTML, PHP and CSS. Hex colour codes start with #. 
		<img src="img/pa/design/1.png" alt="Main page">
	On the landing page, I will have a large header, in faded light grey (#758799), with my name as the header. I would like the header text to be in Roboto, which is a Google Font.
	<br><br>
	I could add a navigation bar at the top of the webpage, so that the user can access the different pages, however I feel that it would make the webpage more complicated and would move away from the slick design.  Instead, I chose to have the URLs to different webpages underneath the picture. 
	<br><br>
	I am debating whether I should have one set picture in the middle of the webpage, or if I should have a slideshow, where multiple pictures are viewed in a set order. If I were to go with this option, I could either choose a manual slide show, where the user would have to press buttons to be able to see each picture, or automatic, where the pictures are viewed on a timer. 
	<br><br>
	The pictures underneath the large picture element will be used as URLs, to navigate to the different portfolios I have. The pictures will be of the portfolio or an element of the portfolio linked. The URL to the portfolio is the picture, so no matter where the user clicks on the picture, the URL will load that webpage. 
		<img src="img/pa/design/2.png" alt="Next page">
	When the URL is clicked on, it will send the user to the portfolio that the picture represents. 
	An example portfolio webpage is a simple design with the same title style, however with different text. Each page will have the title of the portfolio so that the user knows which page they have gone to. 
	<br><br>
	As the page is for portfolio work, I will have a mixture of text and pictures. The text font will be Roboto to match the title. The text will be aligned to the left of the page however the headers will be centred.  
	<br><br>	
	The page will be a scroll page, and I may add a contents list at the top of the page, so that the user can find the part of the page they need quickly. 
	<br><br>
	I may add extra parts to the website as I go along, as I may find a better way to build or show something, however most of the elements I have shown I will be using. 
	</p>
	<br>
  </div>

  
<!--GITHUB-->

  <div class="grey">
   <h3 class="h3" id=git>Web development: GitHub</h3>
	<p>
		I decided to use GitHub to track changes I made to the website. GitHub is a place where developers can use open-source code, making and tracking changes to both already created code, or new code.  Github will allow me back track at any time, if changes I made were not correct. It will also help me understand other tools that I will need to use along side GitHub. Plesk has the ability to integrate GitHub, so that any changes I make on the website will be shown on GitHub and the website. When coding, I use Visual Studios, that has GitHub built in. Once I have edited the code, I can commit changes, which means the changes have been logged. Once the changes have been logged, I can push any changes to Plesk, which then makes these changes live.
	</p>
	<br>
  </div>


<!--WEB DEVELOPMENT: GETTING STARTED (with case study)-->

  <div class="black">
	<h3 class="h3" id=gs>Web development: Getting Started</h3>
	 <p>The first step is to create the files and folders where the website will be built in. I created a main folder called “leannejade.co.uk” and created a file called “index.html”. This is where the landing page will be. If the file had a different name to “index.html”, it would not be recognised by the server as the main page, and there would be an error. I also created a file called css, which I will be using later. I opened the html file in Notepad ++ and started building the first page of the website.
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <img src="img/pa/start/1.png" alt="The making of index.html">
	 <br>
	 To start the webpage, I need to set the doctype declaration. When the page is open, this line of code tells the browser what language the code is written in. This then allows the browser to translate the code into readable text. All HTML webpages need the doctype declaration. 
	 The second line of code defines the language or country combination that the text is written in. 
	 <br><br>
	 </p>
	 <div class="boxed">
		 <span class="tagnamecolor" style="color:black">&lt!doctype html&gt;<br><span class="tagnamecolor" style="color:mediumblue">&lthtml<span class="attributecolor" style="color:red"> lang</span>="en-gb"&gt;</span></span>
	 </div>
	 <p>
	 <br>
	 The next part of the code is the head tag. This tag holds all the metadata, or information of the contents of the webpage. 
	 <br><br>
	 </p>
	 <div class="boxed">
		 <span class="tagnamecolor" style="color:mediumblue">&lthead&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lttitle&gt;
		 <span class="tagcolor" style="color:black">Jade Walker</span>&lt/title&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ltmeta 
		 <span class="attributecolor" style="color:red">charset</span>="utf-8"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ltmeta&gt;
		 <span class="attributecolor" style="color:red">name</span>="viewport"
		 <span class="attributecolor" style="color:red">content</span>="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ltlink&gt;
		 <span class="attributecolor" style="color:red">rel</span>="stylesheet" 
		 <span class="attributecolor" style="color:red">href</span>="css/custom.css"&gt;<br> &lthead&gt;
		 </span>
	 </div>
	 <p>
	 <br>
	 The first line of the head tag is the page title. This is the text shown on the tab bar at the top of the browser. This identifies what the site is, so if the user change tabs, they can get to the right one quickly. I chose to create a < div > tag, so that I could use the class attribute to give the header and the header text different styles. The h1 tag will hold the header text.
	 <br><br>
	 </p>
	 <div class="boxed">
		 <span class="tagnamecolor" style="color:mediumblue">&ltdiv 
		 <span class="attributecolor" style="color:red">class</span>="header"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lth1&gt;
		 <span class="tagcolor" style="color:black">Jade Walker</span>&lt/h1&gt;<br>&lt/div&gt;
	 </div>
	 <p>
	 <br>
	 How it is time to see how the website looks.
	 <br>
	 </p>
	 <img src="img/pa/start/2.png" alt="Tab">
	 <img src="img/pa/start/3.png" alt="Website preview">
	 <p>
	 The page title shows on the tab bar. This is exactly what I wanted. Other than adding a logo next to my name, no further action is needed on that element of the site. However, when looking at the webpage, I can see that the text sits to the left of the page and is quite small. As well as the header not being correct, I am also missing the band of colour at the top. This is because I have yet to create a CSS file and style them both.
	 <img src="img/pa/start/4.png" alt="Making of custom.css">
	 In my CSS folder I made previously, I have created a custom.css file. This is the file I had linked back in the &lthead&gt; tag. CCS means “Cascading Style Sheet” and means that any styles in the file are used across the site. For example, if I have a paragraph (&ltp&gt;) with a font of 12px in the style sheet, every piece of text inside a &ltp&gt; tag across the site will have 12px font.
	 <br><br>
	 Firstly, I wanted the h1 tag, which holds my text, to be centred. ‘text-align’ is a CSS style which moves any text with the style applied to any position on the page. ‘text-align: center’ means that the text will be in the centre of the page.
	 </p>
	 <div class="boxed">
		 <span class="tagnamecolor" style="color:mediumblue">h1
		 <span class="attributecolor" style="color:black">&lbrace;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		 <span class="tagnamecolor" style="color:#8B4BBE">text-align
		 <span class="tagcolor" style="color:black">: center;</span><br></span>&rbrace;</span></span>
	 </div>
	 <p>
	 <br>
	 Now, lets go back to view the page to see what happens.
	 </p>
	 <img src="img/pa/start/5.png" alt="Website preview">
	 <p>
	 Although I can see that the text is in the middle of the page, it is quite difficult to read. The default is 2em, but I would like it to be 4em. Em is a unit of text size. To change the text size, I need to go into the h1 tag again in the style sheet and add another attribute. ‘font-size’ is the size of the font and will recognise many different units of length including px, em and percentages. 
	 <br><br>
	 </p>
		 <div class="boxed">
		 <span class="tagnamecolor" style="color:mediumblue">h1
		 <span class="attributecolor" style="color:black">&lbrace;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="tagnamecolor" style="color:#8B4BBE">text-align
		 <span class="tagcolor" style="color:black">: center;</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font-size
		 <span class="tagcolor" style="color:black">: 4em;</span><br></span>&rbrace;</span></span>
	 </div>
	 <img src="img/pa/start/6.png" alt="Website preview">
	 <p>
	 Now that I had gotten the basics out of the way, I decided to go ahead and start making the website look more appealing.
	 </p>
	 <br>
	 <div class="casestudy">
		<img src="img/pa/chlogo.png" alt="Cloud Heroes">
		<p>
			AgencyUK is a company that provides websites using our infrastructure for Hosting Accounts, with SEO and marketing for companies across the UK.		<br>
			<br>
			A recent order from AgencyUK from us had been a hosting account for a well-known charity. A few days after sending over the details to access their new hosting account and setting them up with a new WordPress website to edit, we received a phone call from their account management team in regards to a potentially malware-stricken website. After analyzing the website, the website files, and any logs that were created by the website, I was able to discover that extra files had been uploaded from an alternate source.
			<br>
			<br>
			The most common vulnerability in WordPress that could be used to upload files is the XML-RCP vulnerability. XML-RPC is a file, included in the base install of WordPress, which allows remote connections to the WordPress website. This allows tools and applications to access the website, such as <a href="https://rss.com/blog/how-do-rss-feeds-work/" style="color:#3466AA;">RSS Feeds</a>. Because this allows remote connections without any authentication, this file can be exploited and used to upload malicious content to the website.
			<br>
			<br>
			After we found this, we completed a restoration of the website. Although the website is a few days old, our infrastructure completes a backup in order to catch any changes. We contacted AgencyUK via email and a follow-up phone call with some advice. In this case, we advise that XML-RPC is disabled on this website and any future website they create. If the file is needed, it can be enabled again. We also advised that they install a WordPress plug-in called WordFence, a security plug-in that detects malicious activity, blocks intrusions, and ensures your WordPress website is secure.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			In the Occupational Brief, this covers:
			<br>
			<br>
			Communication: This exchange had originally been over the phone, however, any summaries or updates were also sent via email, to ensure AgencyUK had the correct details to inform their customers. Sometimes we are required to talk to their customers as a third party, however, in this case, we were not required to contact their customers.
			<br>
			<br>
			Security: Unfortunately, WordPress isn't the most secure, however, it is one of the best free website builders for inexperienced website designers. We are aware that there is a demand for WordPress-friendly hosting, so we need to have safety features installed alongside our infrastructure. We have a firewall between servers that hold customers' websites and the outside world, to be the first defense in case of an attack. In the event that an attack reaches the website itself, we have antivirus installed on our web servers to scan website files for malicious code constantly.
			<br>
			<br>
			Problem-solving: We must comply with Cloud Heroes guidelines to complete tasks, as the Cloud Heroes guidelines are in accordance with ISO standards. We use a 3rd party tool to scan for and resolve malware intrusions, along with a backup/restore service as an alternative.
			<br>
			<br>
			Workflow Management: These types of issues are rare, however, these issues are documented thoroughly in tickets. In case the issue becomes more problematic and requires escalating, the ticket needs to include every step both I and the customer completed, with the results of those steps. Escalation would be immediate if any results show that the malware is more widespread, and could affect other websites on the same server.
			<br>
			<br>
			Performance: In this situation, we are investigating and resolving website issues, so we will need to access websites held on a shared system. This will be using a GUI, or a piece of software installed onto a server to make it easier for users to navigate around. Some pieces of software we use are via command line (CLI), are not accessible by users, and can only be accessed by users in the local network.

<!--WEB DEVELOPMENT: THE HEADER-->

  <div class="grey">
  <h3 class="h3" id=head>Web development: The Header</h3>
	<p>
	I wanted to make the header look fancy, but not too complicated. With the plan I had, I decided I wanted the header text to be to one side, with some text underneath it. Having a &ltbr&gt; tag between my first and last name seperates the two on different lines, and makes it look more professional. I then added text underneath my name. I had to create an ID called "undertext" in order to change the font size. The ID gives a specific item a different style from the rest of the same items in the same tag. This means no other text in the &lth1&gt; tag will be affected.
	<br><br>
	</p>
	<div class="boxed">
		<h4>HTML</h4><br><br>
			<span class="tagnamecolor" style="color:mediumblue">&ltdiv 
			<span class="attributecolor" style="color:red">class</span>="header"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lth1&gt;

			<span class="tagcolor" style="color:black">Photography | Technology</span>&lt/h1&gt;<br>&lt/div&gt;</span>
	</div>
	<br>
	<p>
	In the CSS file and in the h1 tag, I had to make sure everything had been in line, which is why I have various styles like "padding-top" which makes sure that there is enough padding above the text and the top of the page. I wanted the text to have spacing between the letters, so I used "letter-spacing" and set it to 9px. I also set the text colour to #ffffff, which is hex code for the colour white.<br><br>
	In the .header attribute, I have a few styles that should make sure that the header spans the whole page. "width: 100%" is the style that is responsible for this. "position:fixed" is the style that should keep the header at the top of the page and visible even when scrolling. I have decided to have the background set to #000000, which is hex for the colour black. This will mean that the text in the h1 tag will be easy to read.<br><br>
	The undertext ID is in the h1 tag. This means any attributes, such as text size, that are in the h1 tag should be the same for anything with the ID tag unless specifically mentioned. I am needing the text size for the text in the undertext ID to be smaller than the text in the h1 tag, however I want everything else, such as text colour, to stay the same.<br><br>

<!--WEB DEVELOPMENT: THE BIG PICTURE-->

	<div class="black">
		<h3 class="h3" id=tbp>Web development: The Big Picture</h3>
		<p>
		To create a big picture at the top of the site, I need to include an img tag, along with some attributes.
		<br>
		</p>
		<div class="boxed">
			<h4>HTML</h4><br><br>
				<span class="tagnamecolor" style="color:mediumblue">&ltimg 
				<span class="attributecolor" style="color:red">class</span>="main"<span class="attributecolor" style="color:red"> src</span>=img/main.jpg<span class="attributecolor" style="color:red"> alt</span>="main"&gt;</span>
		</div>
		<br>
		<p>
		The img tag holds a class, which will allow me to style the image and style any other images within the class. src allows me to link the image that I would like to be viewed on the website. The alt identifies the picture when accessability tools are used on the website, such as screen readers. With the CSS file, I will be creating styles for the img tag and the .main class. For the image tag, I will need to make sure that it spans most of the page, with a small gap between the edge of the image and the edge of the site. This is what margin-top and margin-bottom is.
		<br><br>
		The .main class makes sure that specific picture fits with the rest of the page.

<!--WEB DEVELOPMENT: ABOUT ME (with case study)-->

	<div class="grey">
		<h3 class="h3" id=aboutme>Web development: About Me</h3>
		<p>
		The next steps are to create an "About me" box, which should explain how I came to understand everything I learned. I will only need a small piece of text, &ltp&gt;, with the header, &lth2&gt; above it. This will contain a large paragraph about myself, similar to a cover letter, describing work I've completed and skills I would like to showcase. The whole of the "About Me" box will be held by the &ltdiv&gt; tag. It will also have a class, which means I can style the &ltdiv&gt; box.
		The &lth2&gt; tag will hold the title, and will be styled differently than the rest of the text on the page.
		The &ltp&gt; tag, holds the main text.

		<br>
		<p>
		The CSS will be black, so that it could compare with the background colour behind the picture above. I also made sure that the colour of the text had been set to white #ffffff. By adding the text colour into class, text on top of every black segment will be white, and I won't need to add it into the h tags or p tags. In order to get the text to center, I had to add padding and margin to the CSS.

		<div class="casestudy">
			<img src="img/pa/chlogo.png" alt="Cloud Heroes">
			<p>
				At Cloud Heroes, we back all systems up to a remote server in the event of a disaster recovery event. We use a service called Acronis, which uses a mixture of data retention and cyber security to keep systems safe and secure. We were in the process from migrating from another backup software which did not fit the needs of the company or the customers we have, and I was requested by the CTO to complete research about Acronis to see if it is a better fit. My research is linked <a href="f/acronis-research.pdf" target=”_blank”
				style="color:#3466AA;">here</a>.
				<br>
				<br>
				The company decided that switching to Acronis would benefit the company, and I was tasked to move all servers and VPS' we ran both internally and for customers over to the new service. Unfortunately, midway though the move with one of our customers' VPS', I encountered some issues. I communicated with the CTO, who provided me with information he had regarding the error I had received, and advised me to contact the supplier. I decided to set up a meeting with our Account Manager over at Acronis to see if they had any information to provide. Our Account Manager described the error with me, and what may have caused it. He also assisted me in the resolution via a remote connection, and verbalized the process which he went through to stop the error and allow the VPS to complete a full backup. With the information both the CTO and the Account Manager provided, I have been able to fix this particular error that has come up many times while I have been at Cloud Heroes.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				In the Occupational Brief, this covers:
				<br>
				<br>
				Communication: We do not hear from Acronis in regards to their software. We are usually the ones to start a support ticket or an email ticket with them.
				<br>
				<br>
				Security: The CTO has a main account to manage all servers and VPS' backups. The support team have access to most servers and VPS' except any company that has a support contract or out of hours support, which the CTO completes. This process meets the companies standards and Cyber Essentials, as there is restricted access depending on company roles. This is to protect our end customers and their data.
				<br>
				<br>
				Problem solving: We must be compliant with Cloud Heroes guidelines to complete tasks, as the Cloud Heroes guidelines are in accordance with ISO standards. Any issues will be passed confidentially over to the necessary parties internally via email or an internal ticket, unless resouces are exhausted and we require assistance from the supplier.
				<br>
				<br>
				Workflow Management: We only receive these types of errors rarely, so they are allocated to the person who has the knowledge to complete the task efficiently. Tasks like this may require more than one person depending on the error.
				<br>
				<br>
				Performance: Depending on the server, it can either be shared or dedicated. Servers that hold VPS' may have many running at one time. Acronis can be accessed by a GUI, however some servers and/or VPS' are both on Windows (GUI) and Linux (CLI).

		This is a preview of the main page of the website. I'm very happy with the progress I have made so far. The best part of the website is the header, as it's stuck in place, even when the user scrolls down. If I had to improve the website, I would add a picture carousel. It could either have a timer that moves from one photo to another, or two buttons either side in order for the user to change the photo themselves. I would also add a border around the photos, so that the photos are clearer.

<!--WEB DEVELOPMENT: TEXT DIVIDERS-->

	<div class="grey">
		<h3 class="h3" id=text>Web Development: Text Dividers</h3>
		<p>
		I wanted to separate each element so that the different options could be clearly differentiated, so I decided to add some text dividers. These dividers are going to be different blocks of colour, however, later on I may add some graphics to seperate the two colours. I chose two alternating colours, which are featured on the main page, so there is consistency in the website. The below shows the two different colours (black and grey) set as the class. I had previously set class="black" on a few previous elements, so we can reuse the same code. I do need to define the class on each element, but this means I don't need to add the black class into the CSS file.

		</p>
		<br>
		<div class="boxed">
			<h4>HTML (1st colour option)</h4><br><br>
			<span class="tagnamecolor" style="color:mediumblue">&ltdiv
			<span class="attributecolor" style="color:red">class</span>="black"<br>&lth3&gt;<span class="attributecolor" style="color:black"> Setting up a hosting account </span>&lt/h3&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ltp&gt; <span class="attributecolor" style="color:black">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

		</div>
		<br>
		<p>
		From this code,	it doesn't look like the colour will change. Unless I add some CSS, the colour will not match the website. Here's the CSS I require below:
		</p>
		<br />
		<div class="boxed">
			<h4>CSS (1st colour option)</h4><br><br>
				<span class="tagnamecolor" style="color:red">.black

		</div>
		<br />
		<p>
		As you can see, I didn't make many changes to the grey class, compared to the black class that I previously used, except for the background colour. This means I can use black and grey alternatively in order to seperate each element and making it easier to read the webpage. Here's the result of the code I added:

<!--WEB DEVELOPMENT: XAMPP-->
	
	<div class="black">
		<h3 class="h3" id=xampp>Web development: XAMPP</h3>
		<p>
			XAMPP is a compact program that developers use in order to set up a local development enviroment for their website. XAMPP runs on a developers computer, and then can be loaded, similar to loading a file or a picture but allows all features to be used and tested. This means they do not need to upload and make live half completed websites in order to see the development of the website and fix any issues. This also means that if any errors occured on the website when live, the developer can take the website and load it in a local envoriment and troubleshoot.
			<br />
			<br />
			This program has been a great help for me, as I was able to build the website, and load it locally before uploading it to GitHub and the hosting account. When I finished each element, I was able to check the local version to ensure I had made all the changes I required before committing the changes to GitHub, then syncing it all with the hosting account. It's such a great tool that I first used in college, but developed my understanding more whilst building the website.

<!--WEB DEVELOPMENT: TESTING AND AUDITING (with case study)-->

	<div class="grey">
		<h3 class="h3" id=testing>Web Development: Testing and Auditing</h3>
		<p>
			In order to ensure every element I have added to my website is functioning correctly, I decided to complete an audit on all elements featured in this production log. This is so I can fix and amend any elements that affects the users experience when accessing the website. The table I have created lists the element I am testing, the results I am expecting from the tests and the result I get from these tests. I have also added a row in the table so I understand which elements I need to amend and why. If I were to go back and make changes, I will have a clear understanding of what I need to do in order to have a working website, that is user-friendly and readable.

				At Cloud Heroes, we are always keeping our systems up to date. In order to do this, we complete monthly patching on all systems. Although most patches are feature updates, some patches we install are security updates and we are required to install these, as vulnrabilities are patched. Unfortunately, there are times where an OS has reached end-of-life, and requires a new server to be built in order to support the new and improved OS. This had happened with one of our main web servers, which required a migration of data from one server to another. The main server in question holds over one thousand websites, so the migration task required planning and conversation with co-workers to find the best plan of action. I produced a project plan with the agreed way of working, which was provided to co-workers, and the CTO in order for the plan to be approved.

				style="color:#3466AA;">Migration Project Plan</a>
				<br />
				<br />
				I was given the role as Project Manager for this, with my co-workers completing migration work alongside myself for efficiency. If we ran into any issues in migrating a website, for example it was no longer compatible on the new system and changes were required, we could flag the issue with our website developer for assistance. He would then start an investigation on the website, and find the reason and the resolution for the error.
				<br />
				<br />
				At the time of writing, we are migrating the second batch of websites. We have migrated over 300 websites in the space of a year, and are hoping to complete the rest over the next year, as the main system that previously held the website is no longer suitable for the amount of users using and accessing the system on a daily basis. Our next step after this would migrate email services from this same system to a newer system.

		<p>
			An SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a protocol which allows secure connection to a service, in this case it's for a website. An SSL is the main reason why links can load as "HTTPS" instead of "HTTP", where the S standands for secure. When installing the SSL to this website, I required to create a certificate which confirms the identity of the website to allow a secure connection. This was possible through the Plesk panel. The SSL is provided LetsEncrypt; a non-profit focused on providing free SSLs for websites in order to allow secure access to services for everyone.
			<br>
			<br>
			These SSLs are temporary and lasts around 3 months. You are able to purchase SSLs that last 1 year from the date of install from reputable sources.

			<b>David Shears - Helpdesk Co-ordinator:</b>

			Jade has grown significantly in her role at Cloud Heroes since joining us in early 2021. She has developed a polite and professional manner when communicating with customers on the phone and electronically. Jade is able to deal with most first-line requests independently and is capable of covering the helpdesk single-handedly when required. She has had the opportunity to visit customer sites and we receive positive feedback following her interactions with clients. Jade is quick to volunteer for work that is appropriate to her role and has a willingness to learn and contribute to shaping internal work practices.<br><br><br><br>
			<b>Michelle Walker - Operations Manager:</b>
			<br><br>
			Since joining Cloud Heroes in early 2021, Jade has become a highly valued member of the team.  Her confidence has grown significantly, and she has developed a gracious and professional manner when communicating with customers. 
			Jade is very quick to volunteer for tasks/projects and has demonstrated her ability to be organised and diligent when managing workloads.  She is able to resolve the majority of first-line support requests independently and has recently completed a couple of customer site visits which has resulted in very positive feedback.
